        <h2>How Space Affects The Future Economy</h2>
        <p>
            In the near future, when we can extract resources from outer space like asteroid mining, we will have access
            to more than enough to sustain humanity's exponential need for energy. However, the cost of space
            exploration will create a feeling of artificial scarcity. In the far future, the expansion of the universe
            will also contribute to the increase in the cost of space exploration. Because the speed of light is
            constant, yet space expands, we need to develop faster-than-light technologies like the Alcubierre drive,
            which works by contracting space in front of it and expanding space behind it, making space travel superbly
            efficient.

        <h2>Happiness from the Simple Things in Life</h2>
        <p>
            The sources of happiness should be sustainable, achievable, and practical. In this way, we could enjoy life
            without much stress. Buying the newest products, focusing on our social following, and following the latest
            trends to remain happy takes a lot of energy, time, and money. Compared to more sustainable activities like
            listening to music, we are walking in the park, spending time with friends, enjoying hobbies, gazing into
            the sky, and admiring the weather. Finding happiness in such simple things is a peaceful journey towards
            contentment.

        <h2>Values in the Age of Information</h2>
        <p>
            In the information age, we no longer need to worry about finding information but must focus on finding the
            right information. So much information is available online, and it can be not easy to know what is true and
            what is not. We need to be able to identify reliable sources of information, and we need to be able to think
            critically about the information we find. The information should also be valuable; we should not just
            passively consume quick content on social media. The information we must learn should contribute to our
            knowledge, skills, and personal development. We should ensure that the knowledge we gain from the internet
            should benefit ourselves and others around us, online and offline.
