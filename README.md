Hi! Your probably here because your interested in how I coded my personal website! Well, it's just plain old HTML, CSS, n' Javascript! I used [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) for added responsive CSS features and [typed.js](https://github.com/mattboldt/typed.js) to animate the text as if it's being written in real time!

You can visit it [here](grantleycullar.com)! ＼(＾▽＾)／
